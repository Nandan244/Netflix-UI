This project is a clone of the NETFLIX web app .I have created the UI of Home Page , Register Page , Login Page , Watch Section And a Movie Playing Page for this project. No API integration is used .

Since this project is mainly done for the UI purpose , no validation procedures have been added at the login and register page section.

But for better user experience , routing on button clicks and movie playing features have been integrated.
And also trailer playing on hover effects have also been added.

The demo screenshots for the better idea of  this project is provided below :
